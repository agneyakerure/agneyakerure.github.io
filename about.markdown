Hi! I am Agneya Kerure. I am 26 years old and I live in San Diego. I work at PlayStation San Diego Studios as an Audio Software Engineer on [MLB The Show](https://news.theshownation.com/).

I love software engineering and signal processing. This is my blog about software engineering and audio signal processing.

I also like to play the guitar, hike and surf.

Here is a cool photo of me:

Note to self - if you forget how Jekyll works:
1. Bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload will host the website on a local server
2. ctrl + c will stop the server
3. just create a new post using sublime text and add to git using git add . commit and push
