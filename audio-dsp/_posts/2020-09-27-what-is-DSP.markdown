### What is Signal Processing and why should I be bothered by it?

Watch the video of the song [Sensual Seduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1PVmANeyAg) by Snoop Dogg. It is pretty cool. You may not like Snoop Dogg or his music - but the video demonstrates how he uses technology to achieve a cool look and sound for his video and song.

Within the first 40 seconds of the song, you see a video shot like it was recorded in the 90s and you hear Snoop Dogg sing in perfect pitch. All that is done using signal processing. If Snoop uses it - it has to be cool. You should definitely be bothered by it, at least a little.

Needless to say, signals and signal processing are pervasive in our world. Signals are everywhere. Your phone does signal processing when it applies filters to your photo/video, your favorite singer does signal processing when they auto-tune their vocals while recording songs, your brain does signal processing when it recognizes food you don't like and makes you order pizza instead.

Signals convey information. You can extract information from signals and use that information to do cool stuff. I can record my voice - that is a signal. I can change its pitch - that is processing. I can make myself sound like a chipmunk - that is the cool stuff. Sattelites and radars work in a very similar way - they're just a teeny bit more complicated.

You should care about it for a few reasons:

1. It is an interesting field of study which allows you to understand the world better and learn how technology helps people communicate.
2. Studying signal processing can help you create cool and interesting technology to help change lives.
3. You are going through this blog because you have to learn it for school/your job and have no other choice.
4. I am asking you to read this and since you are a nice person, you are reding it and are going to tell me that it is a good post and that you appreciate my efforts.
5. You are a potential employer, in which case - Hello! Hope you like this blog. I am very good at programming and signal processing. Hire me.

This blog is my attempt to try to explain signal processing in a fun and easy way.
